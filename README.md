# Falling-Ball_Simulation

Coded using the SMFL libraries!

One of my first programming projects. Just found it while digging through my hard drive.
Looking at the code, I realized that I was such a mess at coding back then.

This program simulates balls of various sizes and masses falling in a 2D space.

Upon starting a window with black background will appear.
Right click anywhere to generate a while ball (the size and mass are randomly generated)!
The ball will fall from the top of the window to the bottom, and it also might bounce if it hits something!
Multiples can exist at once, which generates some funky interaction.
